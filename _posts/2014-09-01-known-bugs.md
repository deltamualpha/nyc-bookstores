Known problems:

* OpenStreetMap does this weird clumping thing with pins. I need to see if I can make it not do that.
* The list of stores doesn't sort.
* The blog is very ugly, and needs lots of css work.
* The fact that the site uses a google spreadsheet to store the bookstore locations, while sort of interesting technologically, doesn't actually make sense because I'm the only person updating it, and is noticibly slow to load.
